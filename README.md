Twitter-viz
===========

My goals with this project is:

1. Play with the twitter API in javascript.
2. Play a little with jQuery, css-selectors and effects.
3. Try twitter bootstrap for the layout/formatting of the page.
4. Write code to download all the tweets for a user.
5. Extract the code for downloading the tweets into an object.
6. Create visualizations of the data
7. Analyze the data in web-workers.

I have not started on points 6 and 7 yet.
